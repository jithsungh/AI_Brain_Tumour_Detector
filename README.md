# Automated Pipeline for Brain Tumor Detection and Classification

## Overview
This project focuses on automating the detection and classification of brain tumors using MRI images. The system leverages YOLOv7 for real-time tumor detection, enabling accurate and efficient medical imaging analysis.

## Features
- **Automated MRI Image Processing**: Preprocessing and normalization of MRI scans.
- **Brain Tumor Detection**: Utilizes YOLOv7 for precise tumor localization.
- **Tumor Classification**: Categorizes detected tumors into different types based on trained models.
- **Google Colab Compatibility**: Run and train models efficiently using cloud resources.
- **Visualization Tools**: Provides annotated images and statistical insights for better analysis.

## Technologies Used
- **YOLOv7**: State-of-the-art object detection model for tumor identification.
- **TensorFlow & PyTorch**: Deep learning frameworks for training and inference.
- **OpenCV**: Image processing and data augmentation.
- **Google Colab**: Cloud-based training and experimentation.
- **Python**: Primary programming language.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Google Colab account
- Required Python libraries: OpenCV, TensorFlow, PyTorch, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
